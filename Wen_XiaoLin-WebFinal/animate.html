            <!--Description -->
            <p>
                My time based media included an animation of my giraffe character waking up in the morning and having his daily cabbage and coffee breakfast. Although time was limited, I was satisfied with the end results of my animation. However, things that could have been improved would be the movements and transitioning of scenes.
